  description: |
    # Overview
    Use this API to submit monthly reports of current-year ISA subscription data. 
    Before you can use the API, you must be approved by HMRC as an ISA manager. 
    In future, enrolment for digital ISA reporting will also be required.

    # Supported use cases
    - Submit monthly reports of current-year subscription data, including transfers and withdrawals.
    - Check the status of submitted reports to confirm processing.
    - Retrieve reconciliation results in batches using pagination.

    # Integration requirements
    - REST API using JSON over HTTPS.
    - Each report must cover activity from the 6th of one month to the 5th of the next.
    - You must submit your monthly report between the 6th and 23:59 on the 19th.
    - Authentication uses the OAuth 2.0 client credentials grant.
    - All API calls require a unique identifier (Z-Reference) assigned by HMRC to each approved ISA manager.

    # Support
    If you need help, complete the [support form](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/support). 
    HMRC's Software Developers Support Team will reply within two working days.

      To submit a monthly report, you must follow a two-step process:
      1. Submit one or more batches of account records.
      2. Mark the report as complete after all account records have been submitted.
      
      Both steps must be completed in order. 
      A report is considered submitted only after it has been marked as complete, and it cannot be amended after submission.

  - name: Check report results
    description: |
      After a monthly report is marked complete and the reporting window closes, 
      HMRC will begin a process that reconciles your submission against other ISA managers' submissions. 
      This will involve validation against business rules and checks on each investor's eligibility and their annual ISA subscription limits.

      You can check the status of a submitted report and retrieve the reconciliation results when available. 
      Reconciliation results include accepted records and details of any reconciliation issues. 
      Results are paginated to support large datasets.

      description: |
        Use this endpoint to upload a batch of account records. 
        A batch is a single payload containing multiple records for the specified monthly report. The payload size of each request must not exceed 10 MB. 
        
        The API checks whether the reporting window is open and whether a report has already been submitted for the specified tax year and report month. 
        If either condition is not met, the API returns a `403 Forbidden` response.

        If the request is permitted:
        - the payload is validated against the expected structure
        - business validation rules are not applied at this stage

        If structural validation fails, the API returns a `400 Bad Request` response. 
        For example, a missing National Insurance number or account number will cause the request to fail. 
        Valid records will be processed only after the report is marked as complete.
        
        A successful submission returns a `204 No Content` response. 
        
        Submit all data batches before completing the monthly report.

        Declaring a monthly report as complete is a legal confirmation that all

      summary: Get report reconciliation results
      description: |
        After the results summary is available, use this endpoint to retrieve the reconciliation results for the monthly report. 
        The API returns reconciliation results in paginated batches. 
        These show which records were accepted and which were rejected, including error messages where applicable.
        
        If the request is successful, the response includes:
        - pagination information, including page number, total pages, and total records
        - the reconciliation results for the current page, including record-level identifiers and any reconciliation errors
        
        If the reconciliation results are not yet available, or if the specified page or report is not found, 
        the API returns a `404 Not Found` response.

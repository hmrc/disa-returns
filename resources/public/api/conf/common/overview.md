Use this API to submit monthly returns of current-year ISA subscription data. Before you can use the API, you must be approved by HMRC as an ISA provider and enrolled for digital returns. If you are not yet approved, you can apply for both approval and enrolment through the DISA registration service.

The API supports the digitalisation of ISA returns by enabling secure, standardised and frequent digital reporting. This helps HMRC detect errors quickly and improve oversight during the tax year.

You can use the API to:

- submit monthly returns of current-year subscription data, including related transfers, withdrawals, and corrections
- check the status of submitted returns to confirm processing or availability of results
- retrieve validation results to identify accepted records and correct any errors

Each return must cover activity from the 6th of one month to the 5th of the next. You must submit your monthly return between the 6th and midnight on the 19th.

The API is designed for integration into ISA providersâ€™ software systems to support regular, accurate digital returns. It currently supports only monthly returns of current-year subscription data. Annual submissions are not yet available.
